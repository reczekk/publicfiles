Here I provide a brief background on spin modelling and some context to the code outlined in Spin_modelling_example.

In the example, I make use of a Monte Carlo algorithm to sample magnetic structures from a very large phase space. 
As with most MC implementations, the phase space of spin configurations is difficult to sample from directly, so the MC algorithm
works by proposing a spin flip and then directly calculating the resulting energy change due to the update. By iterating this multiple times
over each spin in the lattice, we can find an approximate ground state configuration.

The code in Spin_modelling_example is similar to one constructed to provide a microscopic understanding of S=7/2 Europium moments in Eu5Sn2As6.
The software takes in a crystallographic information file (.cif) and constructs a lattice based on a few parameters pertaining to spin magnitude 
and system size. The code sets interactions based on bond lengths and uses a MC algorithm to find the lowest energy state for a given 
external field and temperature. This process is iteratively completed for different field and temperature points to provide data to match to
measurements like magnetic hysteresis, magnetic susceptibility, and specific magnetic structures for low-energy states.
